These samples reference the NuGet package [Microsoft.Graphics.Win2D](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graphics.Win2D), 
which will be automatically downloaded when you build the sample, so there is no need to 
separately install Win2D itself. Win2D [source code](http://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D) 
is also available for those who like to see how the sausage is made.

For more information about Win2D, see its [documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/Win2D).
